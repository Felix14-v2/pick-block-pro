# **Pick Block Pro**

Pick Block: Get the block/item of what you're looking at in creative or switch to that block/item in survival.  
This mod is an advanced version of this and adds a lot of extra features (see below)

**Important:**  
This mod does not alter the default pick block, instead it adds a new one.  
Make sure to set the keybindings in the settings to be able to use this mod.

## **Features**
Everything below is configurable in the config settings using the config file or Mod Menu
- Extended block pick range, decide how far the picker should be able to reach
- Pick block extra things:  
      - Pick fluids and get a bucket of the fluid  
      - Pick fire and get a flint & steel  
      - Pick the sun and get a light block  
- Lock inventory slots to prevent the picker from switching or replacing the item in that slot
- Hold ALT while picking and add BlockState data to the block/item (stacks with CTRL for BlockEntity data)
- Pick ID's with the ID Picker and copy them directly to your clipboard, for easy WorldEdit command creation
- Use the Tool Picker and get the best available tool to break the block or kill the entity
- Creative inventory management (not just the hotbar) is now actually possible when picking blocks
